## Understanding shortlink storage

The `acmcsuf.com/*` shortlinks are stored in a static JSON file
[`src/lib/public/links/links.json`](https://acmcsuf.com/code/blob/main/src/lib/public/links/links.json)
(preview all shortlinks on <https://acmcsuf.com/shorter>) tracked in the
[`acmcsuf.com`](https://acmcsuf.com/code) repository on GitHub.

### Format

> **Note**: The format of the JSON file is not required to be known to update
> shortlinks on `acmcsuf.com`. This section is for those who are curious.

The [`acmcsuf.com`](https://acmcsuf.com/code) repository uses a formatter tool
named Prettier to format the JSON file. The formatter is configured in a file
located in the root of the repository,
[`.prettierrc`](https://acmcsuf.com/code/blob/main/.prettierrc). A GitHub
workflow checks if the JSON file is formatted correctly on every push to the
`acmcsuf.com` repository's main branch.

The `links.json` file isâ€¦

- [Standard JSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)
- Indentations are 2 spaces (not tabs)
- Keys and values are wrapped in double quotes (`"`)
- The final property will not have a trailing comma
- The file ends with a newline character

### Example

The destination string of a shortlink may be a
[fully qualified URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

```json
{
  "github": "https://github.com/acmcsufoss",
  "instagram": "https://instagram.com/acmcsuf",
  "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/company/acm-at-csuf"
}
```

| Alias       | Visit                           | Destination                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `github`    | <https://acmcsuf.com/github>    | <https://github.com/acmcsufoss>            |
| `instagram` | <https://acmcsuf.com/instagram> | <https://instagram.com/acmcsuf>            |
| `linkedin`  | <https://acmcsuf.com/linkedin>  | <https://linkedin.com/company/acm-at-csuf> |

Alternatively, the destination string may be a relative path of an existing
shortlink alias, including URL hash or query parameters.

```json
{
  "shorter-readme": "github/shorter#readme",
  "shorter-closed-prs": "github/shorter/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"
}
```

| Alias                | Visit                                    | Destination                                                          | Explanation                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shorter-readme`     | <https://acmcsuf.com/shorter-readme>     | <https://github.com/acmcsufoss/shorter#readme>                       | `https://github.com/acmcsufoss` + `/shorter#readme`                       |
| `shorter-closed-prs` | <https://acmcsuf.com/shorter-closed-prs> | <https://github.com/acmcsuf.com/shorter/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed> | `https://github.com/acmcsuf.com` + `/shorter/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed` |

Additionally, the alias string may be nested to create a hierarchy of
shortlinks.

```json

  "vc/ai": "https://discord.com/channels/710225099923521558/1016446711880745032",
  "vc/algo": "https://discord.com/channels/710225099923521558/935637646762450966",

}
```

## The internal tool

The internal tool is a Discord slash command named _Shorter_ that allows board
members to update `acmcsuf.com` shortlinks with ease.

> **Note**: _Shorter_'s source code is located at
> <https://oss.acmcsuf.com/shorter>!

### Security

This tool takes advantage of Discord's permissions system to elevate the
security of the `acmcsuf.com` repository, allowing only board members to update
shortlinks.

### Operate with confidence

The software is a simple Discord slash command. All that is required to use the
tool is a Discord account with the `Board Member` role on the
[ACM CSUF Discord server](https://acmcsuf.com/discord).

- This slash command is only available to members with the `Board Member` role.
- This slash command is available in all text channels of the
  [ACM CSUF Discord server](https://acmcsuf.com/discord).
- Type `/shorter` in any text channel to use the tool.
- Populate both required fields `alias` and `destination` with your desired
  alias string and destination string, respectively.
- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit the update.
- Wait for the response from the slash command to confirm the update. This may
  take around 3 seconds.
- Wait for redeployment to complete. This may take around 30 seconds.
